Simple project, that is using lazy loading module and RadDataForm together

The Lazy loaded module contains a data form that is woring properly on Android, but the the whole application exists without any log error on IOS 
This is this the problem that we are trying to solve!
Thank you so much for your time and help


'feature' folder contains the lazy loaded module 

'feature'/'test' folder contains a dataform 


Download the project and run the command 

tns run ios
